# AngularIntro
My first angular projects
My first completed project in angular after Brad's tutorial on Traversy Media yt channel.
After finishing the project, I became familiar with the peculiarities of Angular, what a module means, what a component is, how to make property binding, to use ngClass, ngIf. After watching it 10 times I can say that I had "aha" moments every time. I still have gaps regarding Observables, Subject (although I understand conceptually) I feel that I need to deepen.
